<p>He received a PhD degree in physical engineering in 2014 from UTARTU (Estonia), focusing on motion and humidity sensing properties of soft ionic electroactive laminates based on carbon-polymer composites. His work at UTARTU targeted matching of soft, ionic and capacitive artificial muscle technology to the requirements imposed by soft robotics, demonstrating the very first prototypes of one-gram-scale energy-autonomous soft robots propelled by artificial muscles. From 2015 to 2016 he developed ion-selective polymeric membranes for water quality assessment applications as a postdoctoral researcher in Uppsala University (Sweden). In 2016 he joined the Twinning project partner the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) as a postdoctoral researcher, where he explored actuation and stiffness modulation strategies in plants for technological implementation in plant-inspired robotic scenarios. He currently pursues novel bioinspired soft and flexible robotic technologies in UTARTU, Estonia. In particular, he is interested in textile as a platform for robotics, targeting soft and flexible integrated wearable solutions.</p>

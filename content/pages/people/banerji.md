{{< figure src="../banerji.jpg" title="Research Fellow (CMOS-MEMS, microfabrication, microelectronic design)" >}}

She received her M.Sc. degree in electronics from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2014. Her dissertation focused on developing an ultrasonic IC link for wireless power and data transfer integrated with MEMS ultrasonic transducers for wireless medical devices implanted deep inside the patient’s body. She received a Ph.D. degree, with an FI AGAUR grant from Catalonian government, in the fields of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) design and circuits and designing control architectures for MEMS sensors signal conditioning with the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain in November, 2017. Towards the completion of her Ph.D, she started worked in a CMOS-MEMS startup as a Simulation and Characterization Engineer, Nanusens for a year. In September 2018, she joined University of Tartu as a Research Fellow in microfabrication. Here, she is working towards the design and characterization of micro-systems by integrating ionic electroactive polymers (IEAP) sensors with CMOS electronics, for medical technologies.

### Researcher in Materials Science in the IMS lab, University of Tartu

Janno Torop received a PhD degree in physical engineering from University of Tartu in 2012. In spring 2013 he joined Biosensors and Bioelectronics Centre at Link√∂ping University as postdoc. In 2015 he got a visiting researcher fellowship in Lappeenranta Technical University in Finland. His current research interests are related to electroactive film actuators and bioengineered sensor systems by combining porous carbon materials and conjugated polymers in order to improve energy efficiency during actuation cycle. He has contributed to open-source medical devices development and started a research on biopolymeric hydrogels.

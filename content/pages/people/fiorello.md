Isabella Fiorello is a PhD student in Biorobotics jointly at Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna (SSSA) in Pisa and at the Center for Micro-BioRobotics (CMBR) of Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) in Pontedera (Italy) under the supervision of the CMBR Director, Dr Barbara Mazzolai. She received a BSc in Molecular Biology in 2014 and a MSc in Industrial Biotechnology (with Honours) in 2017 from the University of Turin (Italy). Her research focuses on bio-inspired technologies for exploration tasks, by combining different disciplines, such as biology, engineering and robotics. Particularly, she has been studying the biological features of climbing plants to develop bio-inspired soft robots and smart devices able to work in different unstructured environments.
